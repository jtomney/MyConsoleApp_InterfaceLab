1) Create a new class, "ConsoleLogger", for the project
2) Have it inherit the ILogger interface
3) Implement the interface so that it handles the LogMsg method by writing the message to the console
4) In the Program class, under the ComposeApp method, set the _logger field to a new instance of the ConsoleLogger
*** Verify your project runs and produces the expected message in the console ***
5) Add another class, "FileSystemLogger", to the project
6) Have it inherit the ILogger
7) Implement the interface so that it writes out the log message to to a file (you can hard code the location and file name, not important)
8) Adjust your ComposeApp to now set the _logger field to a new instance of your FileSystemLogger
*** Verify that your project runs and producse the expected log file ***
9) Add an appSetting to the configuration file
    a) key = "Logger"
    b) value = "ConsoleLogger"
10) Amend your code in the ComposeApp so that it retrieves the value of the appSetting and them uses it 
    to determine which concrete instance of ILogger should be used (the console logger or the file system logger)
*** Verify that you can run the program and it can use either logger based on what is in the App.config file ***
